Cloud Cake Cafe is a spaceman/hangman inspired word game. The game challenges players to decipher hidden words by strategically selecting letters. With each correct guess, letters are revealed while incorrect guesses deplete the limited attempts available. Visual aids, including a gradually revealing progress image and a visible guess count, assist players through the game.

### Features
* **Sequiential Word Progression:** Words follow a sequence from shorter to longer, offering a progressively challenging experience.
* **Game Over/Restart:** Using all of the limited guesses requires a game restart, adding a memory game element.
* **End Game Achievement:** Successful playthrough culminate in a congratulatory end-of-game screen.
